The Gem project uses the MIT license for all original code.

For code copied from other projects:

     The copyright & code is enclosed in:

         #
         #<copyright>
         #
         #      Copyright ...
         #
         def external_code()
            pass
         #</copyright>

    Any changes to the copyright code are between the <copyright> and </copyright> tags, and
    [for simplicity] are dual licensed by both the MIT license & the same license as the external
    code.

    NOTE:  Dual license only applies to the changes, not to the original code which is obviously
           only licensed under the original license.
